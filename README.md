[python-gnupg](https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-gnupg/) is a Python package for encrypting and decrypting strings or files using [GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard). GPG is an open source alternative to Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). A popular use of GPG and PGP is encrypting email. For more information, see the [python-gnupg documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/python-gnupg/). Another option for encrypting data from Python is [keyczar](https://github.com/google/keyczar).
